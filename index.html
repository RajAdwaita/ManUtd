                <p>Bruno Fernandes sent Paul Pogba a happy birthday message via social media – and couldn't help but reveal how much he misses his fellow midfielder out on the pitch. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted that Paul could be available for Thursday's Europa League second leg with AC Milan and, for Fernandes, it seems Pogba's return cannot come soon enough.</p>

                <h2>ABOUT US</h2><br><br>
                <p>Manchester United is the biggest most famous football club not only in England but worldwide. It has the largest fan base in the world with over 50 million supporters. They have had the greatest average attendance in England for 36 out of the last 40 years and their stadium old Trafford located in greater Manchester is consistently full to capacity for every home game which is about 76,000 fans. </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>The club was founded in 1878 but not as Manchester United but as Newton Heath L & YR f.c. Newton Heath was a depot for the Lancashire and Yorkshire railways, and the club was set up as the workers football team. The team played on a small football pitch near Manchester Piccadilly station for 15 years before moving to Bank Street in 1893. </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Sir Alex Ferguson took over Man Utd in 1986 and was giving the task of taking the club back to its former glory. In his first season they finished in 11th place and the pressure was mounting. Ferguson’s reign as United manager looked over in 1990 as united were not in contention for the league but thanks to Mark Hughes united went on to win the FA cup. </p>

            <p>Manchester united have the greatest fan base in the world but this was not always the case. In the early days before world war two, people in Manchester were neither man united fans nor man city fans as it was impossible to travel to away games they would just go the home matches and because their was only one home match every two weeks fans would go to either of the Manchester teams home matches.</p>
